# Restaurant-Ordering-System
This was my final project for the OOP244 course. It is a C++ application.

Overview
This project is a C++ application designed to help restaurant waiters efficiently take customer orders for food and drinks and generate detailed bills. Each order results in a unique bill that is saved as a separate file for easy tracking and record-keeping.

Features
- Order Management: Allows waiters to take customer orders for food and beverages.
- Bill Generation: Automatically generates a unique bill for each order.
- File Storage: Saves each bill in a separate file named according to its unique bill number for organization and future reference.

Key Concepts Practiced
- File Handling in C++: Storing and retrieving data from files.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Designing the application using classes and objects.
- Input/Output Streams: Efficiently managing user input and output.
- Dynamic Memory Management: Handling memory allocation and deallocation.

Tech Stack
- Language: C++
